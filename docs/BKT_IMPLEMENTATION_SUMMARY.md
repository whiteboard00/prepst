## üöÄ Next Steps: Running the System

### 1. Run Database Migrations

```bash
cd backend
# Apply migrations to your Supabase database
# You'll need to run the two new migration files in order
```

### 2. Test Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Test Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 4. Try the New Features

#### As a Student:

1. **Practice Session:**

   - Start a practice session
   - Answer questions
   - Rate your confidence (1-5 stars) after each answer
   - System automatically tracks time spent
   - BKT updates your mastery in real-time

2. **View Analytics:**

   - Navigate to "Analytics" in dashboard
   - See your predicted SAT scores
   - View skill mastery heatmap
   - Track growth curve over time
   - Identify skills that need work (low mastery, plateaus)

3. **Session Completion:**
   - When you finish a session, a snapshot is automatically created
   - Your progress is tracked historically

## üß† How the BKT Algorithm Works

### Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)

BKT models the probability that a student has mastered a skill using 4 parameters:

1. **P(L‚ÇÄ)** - Prior knowledge (default: 0.25)

   - Initial probability student knows the skill

2. **P(T)** - Learning rate (default: 0.10)

   - Probability of learning from one question

3. **P(G)** - Guess probability (default: 0.25)

   - Probability of correct answer without mastery

4. **P(S)** - Slip probability (default: 0.10)
   - Probability of incorrect answer despite mastery

### Update Formula:

After each answer:

1. **Bayesian update based on evidence** (correct/incorrect)
2. **Apply learning**: `P(L_new) = P(L_updated) + (1 - P(L_updated)) √ó P(T)`
3. **Calculate velocity**: Change in mastery probability

### Cognitive Efficiency Score:

Combines correctness, time spent, confidence, and difficulty:

```
efficiency = correctness √ó time_factor √ó confidence_factor √ó difficulty_adjustment
```

---

## üìä What Gets Tracked

### Per Question:

- User answer
- Time spent (seconds)
- Confidence score (1-5)
- Correctness
- Question difficulty

### Per Skill:

- Current mastery probability (0-1)
- Learning velocity (rate of improvement)
- Total attempts / correct attempts
- Plateau detection flag
- BKT parameters

### Per Session:

- Performance snapshot created
- Predicted SAT scores (math, R/W)
- Average cognitive efficiency
- Skills snapshot (mastery at that moment)

### Historical:

- Growth curves over time
- Learning events log
- Performance snapshots

## üéØ Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

These are from your original vision but not yet built:

### Phase 3+ Items:

1. **Adaptive Question Selection** (IRT-based)

   - Use difficulty parameters to select optimal questions
   - Target 60-70% success rate (desirable difficulty)
   - Match question difficulty to student ability

2. **Plateau Detection & Interventions**

   - Detect when learning velocity decelerates
   - Trigger interventions:
     - First-principle visual simulations
     - Tangential concept bridging
     - Socratic dialogue prompts

3. **Micro-Concepts**

   - Break topics into hundreds of micro-concepts
   - More granular mastery tracking
   - Concept prerequisite mapping

4. **Advanced Cognitive Metrics**
   - Hesitation tracking (answer changes)
   - Time-of-day performance patterns
   - Cognitive energy management

---

## üîß Configuration

Default BKT parameters are in `bkt_service.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_PRIOR = 0.25  # Initial mastery
DEFAULT_LEARN = 0.10  # Learning rate
DEFAULT_GUESS = 0.25  # Guess probability
DEFAULT_SLIP = 0.10   # Slip probability
```

These can be customized per skill in the future based on calibration data.
