# Admin Analytics Dashboard Implementation - Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive admin analytics dashboard that mirrors the functionality of `check_analytics.py` in a web interface. The dashboard provides real-time monitoring of the learning analytics system with role-based access control.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Implementation ✅

#### File: `backend/app/core/auth.py`

Added 6 admin analytics endpoints:

1. **GET /api/analytics/admin/mastery-tracking**

   - Returns user skill mastery statistics
   - Shows mastery probability, attempts, learning velocity
   - Admin sees all users, regular users see only their own

2. **GET /api/analytics/admin/confidence-timing**

   - Returns confidence scores and timing statistics
   - Shows average confidence, time spent per question
   - Includes confidence distribution breakdown

3. **GET /api/analytics/admin/learning-events**

   - Returns learning events grouped by type
   - Shows event counts and breakdown
   - Tracks mastery updates and other events

4. **GET /api/analytics/admin/performance-snapshots**

   - Returns recent performance snapshots
   - Shows predicted SAT scores, avg mastery
   - Ordered by creation date

5. **GET /api/analytics/admin/user-progress**

   - Returns overall user progress summary

   - Calculates skills tracked, accuracy, avg mastery

6. **GET /api/analytics/admin/question-difficulty**
   - Returns IRT difficulty calibration stats (Admin only)

Added 6 new API methods:

- `getMasteryTracking(limit)`
- `getConfidenceTiming(limit)`
- `getLearningEventsStats()`
- `getPerformanceSnapshotsOverview(limit)`
- `getUserProgressSummary()`
- `getQuestionDifficultyStats(limit)`

### 4. Frontend - Reusable Components ✅

#### File: `frontend/components/admin/AnalyticsCard.tsx`

- Card component for each metric section
- Props: title, icon, status, children
- Color-coded by status (success, warning, error, info)
- Displays status icons

#### File: `frontend/components/admin/DataTable.tsx`

- Reusable table component
- Features:

- Last updated timestamp
- Admin badge indicator

**Summary Cards (6 sections):**

1. Mastery Tracking - Shows total records and avg mastery
2. Confidence & Timing - Shows answered questions and averages
3. Learning Events - Shows total events and types
4. Performance Snapshots - Shows snapshot count
5. User Progress - Shows total users with data
6. Question Difficulty (IRT) - Shows calibrated questions

**Expandable Detail Views:**
Each card has a "View Details" button that expands to show:

- Only visible to admin users
- Uses Settings icon for admin section

### 7. Dependencies ✅

#### Installed Recharts

```bash
npm install recharts
```

For data visualization (charts and graphs)

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **User visits** `/dashboard/admin/analytics`
2. **Page loads** and calls all 6 API endpoints in parallel
3. **Backend checks** if user is admin via `is_admin()`
4. **Backend filters** data based on role:
   - Admin: sees all users' data
   - Regular user: sees only their own data
5. **Frontend receives** statistics and displays in cards
6. **User can expand** any card to see detailed tables/charts
7. **User can export** data to CSV for external analysis

### Role-Based Access Control

**Admin Users:**

- See system-wide statistics
- All 6 sections available including Question Difficulty
- Can view data for all users
- Admin badge displayed

**Regular Users:**

- See personal statistics only
- 5 sections available (Question Difficulty is admin-only)
- Data filtered to their user ID
- No admin badge

### Admin Check Logic

Backend checks:

```python
result = db.table("users").select("role").eq("id", user_id).execute()
return result.data and result.data[0].get("role") == "admin"
```

Frontend checks:

```typescript
const isAdmin =
  user?.user_metadata?.role === "admin" || user?.app_metadata?.role === "admin";
```

## Testing

### To Test as Admin:

1. **Set user role in database:**

   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your_email@example.com';
   ```

2. **Start backend:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Start frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Navigate to:**
   `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/admin/analytics`

5. **Verify:**
   - Admin badge shows "Admin View - All Users Data"
   - All 6 cards are visible
   - "Admin Analytics" link in sidebar
   - Data shows multiple users (if available)

### To Test as Regular User:

1. **Ensure role is not admin** (or NULL in database)

   - No admin badge
   - Only personal data visible
   - Question Difficulty section may show "Admin access required"
